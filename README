sidetrack is a wrapper on top of rack 

it's a framework for building webservices in ruby

i got sidetracked while writing another application. 
i didn't want to to use rails to generate a webservice because it's overkill for that.
if you like simple code this is for you. all you rails fanboys and fangirls can
start your hatin' now. you're all sensitive thugs that just need hugs.

sidetrack allows for easy now creation of webservices that respond support GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/HEAD

see a working examples:

http://bit.ly/3Cn0Ev (inactive -- ec2 costs were prohibitive -- now that heroku
is here don't need to spin up an ec2 instance for demos like these)

to run:
ln -sf config/development.ru config.ru
./run.sh
point to http://localhost:12345
